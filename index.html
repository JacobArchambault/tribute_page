                <p>This page, my dear friend, is a tribute to you. Perhaps you were aimlessly browsing the internet, and ended up here without knowing how. Perhaps you deliberately Bing'd or DuckDuckGo'd your way here. Perhaps you are a prospective employer or colleague of mine, disappointed not to find a more traditional tribute page devoted to Mother Theresa, say, or U2. Or perhaps, you, too, are fascinated with you. I'm glad you're here.</p>
                <p>No, Mother Theresa can't touch you. 40 U2 songs are one bad lemon compared to you - with the elevation you bring me, sweetest thing, I'm a kite staring at the sun's unforgettable fire on a beautiful day (take pride in that!).  You were even <em>Time</em> magazine's 2006 <a>Person of the Year</a> (I mean, I won in 1982. But if you're a protesting, ebola-fighting, middle american female Korean War veteran boomer scientist whose spoken out against harassment - and why wouldn't you be, awesomesauce? - you've won ten times!).</p>

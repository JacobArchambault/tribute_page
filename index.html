                    <p>This page, my dear friend, is a tribute to you. Perhaps you unintentionally Bing'd or DuckDuckGo'd your way here. Perhaps you're a colleague, disappointed not to find a more traditional tribute page devoted to Mother Teresa, say, or U2. Or perhaps, you, too, are fascinated with you. I'm glad you're here.</p>
                    <p>No, Mother Teresa can't touch you, and 40 U2 songs are one bad lemon compared to you (take pride in that!).  You were even <em>Time</em> magazine's 2006 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)">Person of the Year</a> (I mean, I won in 1982. But if you're a protesting, ebola-fighting, middle american female Korean War veteran boomer scientist whose spoken out against harassment - and why wouldn't you be, awesomesauce? - you've won ten times!).</p>
